Audit `# type: ignore` to handle updated type hints

Test with bad payloads:
    validate_cert
    validate_csr

Typing
    parse_cert should use a unified type for the rval and return
    MyPy type hints have trouble with:
        foo = [i.decode("utf8") if isinstance(i, bytes) else i for i in bar]

Design
    Explore the notion of using decorators to test for openssl and generate
    any necessary tempfies.  This would potentially look cleaner and be more
    maintainable than the current method of using try/except blocks.

Tests needed for:
    update_from_appsettings
    check_openssl_version
        install weird openssl versions and test against them
