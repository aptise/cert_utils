A handful of functions require `key_pem` but list it as optional.
    This is a legacy behavior from an either/or invocation.
    pem should never be optional; only filepaths should be optional

Audit `# type: ignore` to handle updated type hints

Test with bad payloads:
    validate_cert
    validate_csr


MyPy type hints have trouble with:
        foo = [i.decode("utf8") if isinstance(i, bytes) else i for i in bar]
