Conditional Imports
    imports should be "one at a time", not "all or nothing".
    functions that use imports should test for all necessary options
    write new tests for lacking specific libraries

A handful of functions require `key_pem` but list it as optional.
    This is a legacy behavior from an either/or invocation.
    pem should never be optional; only filepaths should be optional

Audit `# type: ignore` to handle updated type hints

Test with bad payloads:
    validate_cert
    validate_csr


Typing
    parse_cert should use a unified type for the rval and return

    MyPy type hints have trouble with:
        foo = [i.decode("utf8") if isinstance(i, bytes) else i for i in bar]
